Kernel should support 2 modes:

1. Performence
2. Power saving

On time slice expiration, Scheduler should make all calculations in CPU0 thread and signal another Workers to switch contexts.

SVC handling
1. Split service call handling on 2 parts: threadsafe and blocking.
2. Set blocker for process. If routine is already active - set activation flag for it. if it is not active - run routine on current CPU.
3. On routine end, signal Worker that triggered it, to switch on relevant Process. (via InterCoreInterface)


Sequences:
1. Tick
3. Event handling (from SV, from interrupt handler)
